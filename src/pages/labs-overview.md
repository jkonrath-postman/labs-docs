Labs' focus is to test and build new technologies. We're currently working on multiple initiatives, and documentation related to each initiative will be here. What excites us is the ability to truly be on the cutting edge of technology, and in some cases, ahead of it.

## Flows

Flows is a visual tool to create API workflows. You can use Flows to chain requests, handle data and create real world workflows right in your Postman workspace.

## API Client

The API Client team has diligently been working on supporting more protocols within Postman. We started out by addressing WebSockets (and Socket.IO) and continued on with gRPC. We will continue to support and evolve each of these protocols. GraphQL is our next target. If there are other protocols that you think we should address, please check out the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues) discussions.

### GraphQL

APIs made with GraphQL allow clients to ask the server for exactly the data they need. This is enabled by a powerful query interface and a runtime to execute those queries making it easier for developers to quickly explore and experiment with the clientâ€™s functionalities. Contrary to REST, which makes your chunks of data available on multiple endpoints, GraphQL makes working with data simpler and faster with a single endpoint. Plus, GraphQL is schema driven, which means more transparency in terms of API functionality and lower dependency between teams building the client and the server. So, a client can introspect the schema from the server to get an idea about the available data fields, send queries specifying fields to retrieve or manipulate the stored data. The server does exactly what was asked from it and returns only the data requested in the query. Combining these features, GraphQL provides users with a flexible, fast and predictable API experience, making it one of the most popular API technology.

### gRPC

gRPC is a schema-driven Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework often used to enable inter-service communication. Being RPC based, it facilitates client-server communication over a function call instead of an HTTP call. gRPC has gained significant popularity because of its easier abstraction than HTTP, support across multiple languages, and high performance. Postman provides you with a client interface to work with gRPC services. Go through the documentation to learn how to use Postman's gRPC client to test your gRPC API.

### WebSockets

The WebSocket protocol provides a way to exchange data between a client and server over a persistent connection. The data can be passed in both directions with low latency and overhead, and without breaking the connection. WebSockets provide a bidirectional, full-duplex communications channel that operates over HTTP through a single TCP socket connection. This means the server can independently send data to the client without the client having to request it, and vice versa.
